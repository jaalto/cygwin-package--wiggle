ldesc: "A program for applying patches that patch(1) cannot apply due to
conflicting changes in the original. Wiggle will always apply all
changes in the patch to the original. If it cannot find a way to
cleanly apply a patch, it inserts it in the original in a manner
similar to merge(1), and report an unresolvable conflict."
